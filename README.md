# Nuclear Shape Analysis macros

## Nuclear shape analysis.ijm
A Fiji macro for analysing static nuclear shapes in fluorescent images. For a more in depth description see '**Approaches to determine nuclear shape in cells during migration through collagen matrices**' by Martin Svoren, Elena Camerini, Merijn van Erp, Gert-Jan Bakker, and Katarina Wolf in the edition on '**Cell Migration in Three Dimensions**' included in the Lab protocol series '**Methods in Molecular Biology**'.

## Nuclear shape change analysis.ijm
A Fiji macro for analysing the dynamics of nuclear shapes during the migration of cells in 3D matrices. Readouts include the same range of standard shape descriptors as from the Fiji script ‘**Nuclear shape analysis.ijm**’ such as aspect ratio, circularity and nuclear irregularity index (NII), but in addition integrate the calculation of the step-to-step difference between NII values. For a more in depth description see '**Approaches to determine nuclear shape in cells during migration through collagen matrices**' by Martin Svoren, Elena Camerini, Merijn van Erp, Gert-Jan Bakker, and Katarina Wolf in the edition on '**Cell Migration in Three Dimensions**' included in the Lab protocol series '**Methods in Molecular Biology**'.
